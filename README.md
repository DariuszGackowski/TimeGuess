🏛️ TimeGuess App

TimeGuess is an educational mobile game where players guess historical figures, events, and discoveries — using images, quotes, and short historical background as clues.

📚 About the Game

Step into the shoes of a history explorer and test your knowledge across different eras — from ancient civilizations to the modern age. Each quiz card is built from three elements:
An image or icon representing a person, event, or invention
A quote or opinion as the first hint
A historical background (50–70 words) as the second hint
Your goal is to choose the correct answer from four options.

🎮 Question Types

Historical figures (e.g. Julius Caesar, Marie Curie)
Key events (e.g. Battle of Stalingrad, French Revolution)
Discoveries and inventions (e.g. printing press, computer, cuneiform script)
